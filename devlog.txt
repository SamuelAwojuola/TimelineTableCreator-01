I add "value" to tr in tinyMCE valid elements (https://www.tiny.cloud/docs-3x/reference/configuration/Configuration3x@valid_elements/)
This was so that it would not remove the value attribut from the <tr> which I added manually

In testing whether the details addition was working, I had to remove dispaly:none from the template.
I have to restore it, when I am done testing.
